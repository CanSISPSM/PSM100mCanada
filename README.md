# Soil Landscape Grids of Canada at 100 meter Spatial Resolution

With the latest collection of soil point and available co-variables data, the Canadian Soil Information Service(CanSIS) has developed 100m grids of soil type and selected soil attributes of Canada. The 100m soil landscape grids can be used for national and regional soil organic carbon stock inventory and carbon sequestration assessment. There is also potential applications for soil health, soil erosion, land suitability and other large area-based modelling and applications.

The 100m soil landscape grids of Canada data are accessible via a government public facing web site ( https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/nsdb/psm/index.html ) under the Open Government Licence â€“ Canada (https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada). The primary distribution list includes GeoTiff files for SOC, BD, sand, clay, silt, pH (CaCl2 buffered), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) data of five depth intervals including uncertainty data. Soil classes data along with prediction probability are also accessible. The national point soil or pedon data are also accessible via the website (link: https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/nsdb/npdb/index.html  ).
